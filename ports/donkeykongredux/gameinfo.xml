    <desc>When I was 10 years old I got a C64 and thought it could be programmed in natural language. I literally wrote something like:

"I want a game where I am a plumber who needs to avoid barrels that Kong launches,  by jumping them. I need to reach the top of the screen, I can get a hammer etc..."

Unfortunately I only got a syntax error in exchange of my passionate description of the game.

35 years later I found the will to try it again and this time things have gone a bit better.

With this project I am willing to replicate the behaviour of the original Donkey Kong by Nintendo.
I tried to simulate the game logic and timing spending multiple hours watching videos of the original game.

Game copyrights belong entirely to Nintendo.

As a Nintendo's games lover I wanted to express my tribute to the Mario/Donkey Kong serie and to game designer Shigeru Miyamoto.

Game programming is now completed with four brand new levels added on the top of the 4 original ones.</desc>
